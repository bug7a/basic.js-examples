HOW TO USE THIS?

Here are some things you need to know to benefit from these project files.


1. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:

As a code editor, I recommend Visual Studio Code.
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Video for installation and use:

2. WHAT THE FILES DO:

- Each numbered HTM file is a software project developed with JavaScript.
- Projects are numbered starting from easy.
- Each project can run on any browser.
- The "library" folder contains the basic.js library.
- The "images" folder contains images used by some sample projects.
- When creating a new project; Copy the "0C-blank-project-theme.htm" file and the "library" folder to a different folder. Rename the HTM file you copied (project-name.htm etc.) and open this folder in the development environment. (In the narration videos, these stages are shown.)


3. FIRST EXAMPLE PROJECT:

The first example is the project "01-hello.htm".

4. DESIGN ENVIRONMENT:

As an interface design tool, I recommend Figma.

RECOMMENDED WORKING METHOD:

- While watching the narration video of a project; Take notes in the notebook. And think about the working logic of the algorithm.
- Using these notes, rewrite the project. And try to improve it further with additional features that come to mind.
- To use in your project; Also note the use of codes.


I wish you well,
Good work.
