        /*

        ALGORITHM:
            
        - By pressing empty squares on a three by three (3x3) field; It marks it as the "x" or "o" symbol.


        WORKING LOGIC:
            
        - Each field is a image object.
        - The clicked object loads itself the image file of the next symbol.
          

        GAME PLAY:
        
        - One player uses the symbol "x" and the other uses the symbol "o".
        - They continue in turn by placing their symbols on one of the empty squares.
        - Three of its own symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally
        The first player to bring them together wins a point.
        - Until the empty squares are filled, if no one succeeds, it is a draw. And the game restarts.

        DEVELOPMENT SUGGESTIONS:
        
        - When the game is over, the restart button can be added.
        - To keep the scores, a section can be developed.
          For example: A score tag for each user and
          a button that increases them.
        - (DIFFICULT) Automatically detecting the winner, increasing the score and
          A new game-starting algorithm can be added.
        - Think, design and try to develop what else can be improved.
