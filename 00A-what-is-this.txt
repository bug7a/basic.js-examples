WHAT IS THIS?

Object-based project examples for programming beginners. And JavaScript library for developing dynamic user interfaces.


WHO CAN BENEFIT?

- Middle school, high school, and university students.
- Those who want to write code as a hobby.
- Beginners in programming.
- Teachers and parents who want to use it as educational content.


WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?

- Basic units used in programming languages.
- Using the JavaScript programming language.
- Object-based programming logic.
- To be able to develop a project by dividing it into small parts.
- Ability to manage information and create dynamic interfaces.
- To be able to create new and unique objects by combining basic objects.
- Being able to develop better algorithms with practice.


ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION:

- The first 10 projects are specifically designed to help you learn software development logic.
- HTML and CSS codes are written automatically by the library. Thus, students can initially focus only on algorithm development.
- It is built on five basic objects. (Label, Button, TextBox, Image, Box)
- It is designed with an object-based logic close to desktop and mobile application development experience.
- C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Swift, PHP, ASP.NET, etc. It will help you learn programming languages ​​more easily.
- It has the same positioning logic as the interface design tools. This too; It makes it easy to translate your design into an application.
- With these techniques, fully customizable and dynamic applications can be developed.
- The programming language used is JavaScript. Projects can be run in the browser or WebView.
** WebView: Object used to display web content in programming languages.


WHY DO I USE JAVASCRIPT:

- The syntax of the programming language is simple. This makes learning easier.
- Too many resources. There is a high probability that you can find an example or library related to the project you want to do.
- I think it has the most mature, interface rendering technology (HTML and CSS).
- Suitable for general use. With the same knowledge, the software can be developed in different fields.


USAGE AREAS:

1. Web applications.
2. Mobile applications.
